Due to some reasons, GitHub won't let me upload file sizes of more than 25 MB. I uploaded my result file to google drive(link in readme).

I am using Twitter API to get all tweets from December 2019 to March 2020 about vaccines. The size of this file is more than 100MB and I run the Twitter API code for 18 hours on my laptop. The file name is "tweets_geo_vaccine_us_nov_2020_to_mar_2021.csv" Please check it on my google drive folder.

And then I run Google NLP to get sentiment scores about these tweets. The output file is named"score - Sheet1.csv" in the google drive folder with the same link above. 
In this file, I only output the username and the sentiment score.
And I think these can fully show us what do people think about vaccines.
