I want to design software to analyze people's attitudes toward the vaccine during the pandemic. 
As a government, I want to search “Pfizer” on Twitter through Twitter API to see what people think about Pfizer(Using Google NLP API).
As a Moderna researcher, I want to search “Moderna vaccine” on Twitter through Twitter API to see what will people choose between Pfizer and Moderna. 

Module design:
1. get input from users
2. use Google NLP API to get the keywords
3. Upload the keywords to Twitter through Twitter API
4. Get results from Twitter and then upload these tweets to Google NLP API to process the data
5. Output the result and return it to users. 

My users could be:
Salesman
Company manager 
Researcher
Consultant
